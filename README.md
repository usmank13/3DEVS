# 3DEVS

Code for the 3D Electromagnetic Visualization System developed at the Sensor Systems Lab at the University of Washington. The 3DEVS is a full hardware-software system that measures and creates spatial electromagnetic visualizations for inductive charging wireless power. It uses a repurposed CNC machine to collect data from a volume space. The resolution and volume of scans, as well as other settings, are easily reconfigurable.

A research paper describing the system and results will be forthcoming!
