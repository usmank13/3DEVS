#MPFCS

Code for the Mostly Printed Field Characterization System developed at the Sensor Systems Lab at the University of Washington. The 3DEVS is a full hardware-software system that measures and creates spatial electromagnetic visualizations for inductive charging wireless power. It uses a repurposed CNC machine to collect data from a volume space. The resolution and volume of scans, as well as other settings, are easily reconfigurable.
